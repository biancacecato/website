#### Welcome to my website!

I am a Posdoctoral Fellow and Researcher at the [Smart Prosperity Institute](https://institute.smartprosperity.ca/) at the University of Ottawa. I hold a Ph.D. from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.landfood.ubc.ca/), where I studied topics at the intersection of economics and the environment. At SPI my main job is conducting research on nature-based solutions for climate, with a particular focus on market mechanisms to store more carbon in forests, while also conserving biodiversity and helping develop sustainable Indigenous economies. My other research interests include investigating the impact of newspaper closures on monitoring and enforcement of environmental regulations in the United States. Other projects I have focus on developing countries, more specifically on how internal migration can offset losses in consumption caused by weather and climate shocks in Indonesia, and on lead pollution and education outcomes in Mexico. Before joining UBC, I worked as a research analyst for the [Office of the Chief Economist, Latin America and the Caribbean at the World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/lac/brief/lac-chief-economist) in Washington DC, on projects based in Latin America. When I am not in front of my computer, you can find me [here](image/climb.jpg).
