Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD candidate at the [Faculty of Land and Food Systems at the University of British Columbia](https://www.landfood.ubc.ca/). I am studying topics at the intersection of economics and the environment. My main research currently focuses on investigating the impact of newspaper closures on monitoring and enforcement of environmental regulations in the United States. My other projects focus on developing countries, more specifically on how internal migration can offset losses in consumption caused by weather and climate shocks in Indonesia, and on lead pollution and education outcomes in Mexico. I hold an MA in Economics at [PUC-Rio](https://www.puc-rio.br/english/), in Brazil. Before joining UBC, I worked as a research analyst for the [Office of the Chief Economist, Latin America and the Caribbean at the World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/lac/brief/lac-chief-economist) in Washington DC, on projects related to labor markets in Latin America. When I am not in front of my computer, you can find me [here](image/climb.jpg).
